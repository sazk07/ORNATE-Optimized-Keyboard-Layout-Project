RUKIA-for-programming wide mod is new, improved way of typing. It is a wide mod of RUKIA-for-programming with the right hand side moved one key over, from the homing key on the RHS. This allows for easier flexibility between the shoulder blades when typing and adds more dynamic range of motion for the hands because they don't have to be so close together when typing. It does all of that without losing any of the scoring metrics efficiency used on the original RUKIA i.e. it is just as efficient as RUKIA itself, with the added advantage of having more space.

To install the WIDE MOD, download this folder in a zip file, run setup.exe and restart your PC. press Win+Space to change to RUKIA wide mod and enjoy typing. See the image for character positions when first learning to type with RUKIA.
