RUKIA-for-programming wide mod is new, improved way of typing. It is a wide mod of RUKIA-for-programming with the right hand side moved one key over, from the homing key on the RHS. This allows for easier flexibility between the shoulder blades when typing and adds more dynamic range of motion for the hands because they don't have to be so close together when typing.
